# The DEFAULT allows a global definition of the options. They can be overridden
# in each jail afterwards.

[DEFAULT]

# "ignoreip" can be an IP address, a CIDR mask or a DNS host
ignoreip = <%= @ignoreip.join(' ') %>
bantime  = <%= @bantime %>
maxretry = <%= @maxretry %>

# "backend" specifies the backend used to get files modification. Available
# options are "gamin", "polling" and "auto".
# yoh: For some reason Debian shipped python-gamin didn't work as expected
#      This issue left ToDo, so polling is default backend for now
backend = <%= @backend %>

#
# Destination email address used solely for the interpolations in
# jail.{conf,local} configuration files.

#
# ACTIONS
#

# Default banning action (e.g. iptables, iptables-new,
# iptables-multiport, shorewall, etc) It is used to define
# action_* variables. Can be overridden globally or per
# section within jail.local file
banaction = <%= @banaction %>

# email action. Since 0.8.1 upstream fail2ban uses sendmail
# MTA for the mailing. Change mta configuration parameter to mail
# if you want to revert to conventional 'mail'.
mta = <%= @mta %>

# Default protocol
protocol = <%= @protocol %>

# Specify chain where jumps would need to be added in iptables-* actions
chain = <%= @chain %>

#
# Action shortcuts. To be used to define action parameter

# The simplest action to take: ban only
action_ = <%= @action_ %>

# ban & send an e-mail with whois report to the destemail.
action_mw =  <%= @action_mw %>

# ban & send an e-mail with whois report and relevant log lines
# to the destemail.
action_mwl = <%= @action_mwl %>

# Choose default action.  To change, just override value of 'action' with the
# interpolation to the chosen action shortcut (e.g.  action_mw, action_mwl, etc) in jail.local
# globally (section [DEFAULT]) or per specific section
action = <%= @action %>

#
# JAILS
#

# Next jails corresponds to the standard configuration in Fail2ban 0.6 which
# was shipped in Debian. Enable any defined here jail by including
#
# [SECTION_NAME]
# enabled = true

#
# in /etc/fail2ban/jail.local.
#
# Optionally you may override any other parameter (e.g. banaction,
# action, port, logpath, etc) in that section within jail.local
